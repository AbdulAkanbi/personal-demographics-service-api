  title: Personal Demographics Service API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics) - the national electronic database of NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth and NHS Number.

    You can:
    * search for patients
    * get patients' personal details
    * update patients' personal details

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * register births (not required for GPs)
    * register new patients (GPs should do this via [NHAIS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais/nhais-developer-document-library))

    You can currently access the following data:
    * NHS Number
    * name
    * gender
    * birth
    * addresses
    * contact details
    * registered GP
    * preferred pharmacy
    * consent information
    * related people

    ## API status
    This API is in [Alpha](/reference-guide#api-status) - expect significant breaking changes.

    It is currently only available for sandbox testing, not for integration testing or production use.

    The following items are on our roadmap, in rough priority order:
    - addition of data fields that are dependent on upcoming UK Core FHIR profiles.
    - complete sandbox service (currently only GET /Patient/{nhs_number}
    - move from Alpha to Beta
    - authorisation using OAuth 2.0 and NHS Identity
    - integration test service
    - assurance process
    - production service (Beta)
    - exit Beta (once we are sure the service is fit for purpose)

    We are extremely keen to receive feedback on the API,
    for example if there are data fields missing that you think you need.
    Please [get in touch](/help-and-support) with any comments or suggestions.

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://emea-demo8-nhsdportal.apigee.io/introduction-to-apis#basic-rest).

    This API is compliant with the
    [FHIR](https://emea-demo8-nhsdportal.apigee.io/introduction-to-apis#fhir-rest)
    standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it complies with [FHIR R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://emea-demo8-nhsdportal.apigee.io/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis).
    It uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise both the calling system and end user. More details to follow.

    ## Testing
    You can test this API in:
    * our [sandbox environment](/testing#sandbox-testing)
    * our [integration test environment](/testing#integration-testing) (coming soon)

    For sandbox test scenarios and test data, refer to the documentation for individual endpoints.

        ## Overview
        Search for a patient.

        ## Search types
        This endpoint will search for a patient using one of four search types. The choice of search is automatic and will cascade as necessary until results are found.

        ### Simple search
        The fastest match, requires family_name, first_name, gender, birth_date.
        Returns either a single matching patient or nothing. A limited set of parameters can be provided, all of which must exactly match the current information held.

        ### Advanced search
        Can return multiple matching patients if the information provided matches the current information held.
        Supports searching against additional information fields.
        Wildcards (\*) in name and postcode fields are supported.
        Wildcards must be preceeded by at least two characters, i.e. 'Br\*' is valid, but '\*cDougal' is not.
        Multiple wildcards are allowed, for example 'Br\*w\*' will match 'Brown' and 'Brower'.

        ### Advanced historic search
        Identical to advanced except it also searches historic patient data, for example previous names or addresses.

        ### Weighted search
        Returns a percentage match weight for each potentially matching patient. Always searches historical data. Requires at least one of the following combinations of search parameters:
          - family_name, first_name, gender, birth_date (or range)
          - family_name, gender, birth_date (or range), postcode
          - first_name, gender, birth_date (or range), postcode

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment:

        | Scenario                       | Request                                                      | Response                                   |
        | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
        | Successful simple search       | `family`=`Smith`, `given`=`Jane`, `gender`=`female`, `birthdate`=`2010-10-22` | HTTP Status 200 with single search result. |
        | Unsuccessful search            | Any other valid search query parameters                      | HTTP Status 200 with no search results     |
        | Invalid date format            | `birthdate` or `death-date` query parameters with values not in format `YYYY-MM-DD` | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |
        | Too few search parameters      | Any invalid combination of query parameters                  | HTTP Status 400 with problem description   |

    patch:
      description: |
        ## Overview
        Updates specific patient information.
        
        This is a 'patch' operation, meaning you can update specific parts of the patient record (such as a name or an address), as opposed to having to update the entire record.
        
        ## Patient record versioning
        To update a patient's record you must have retrieved it first.
        When you retrieve a patient record, you get a version number for the record (in the `ETag` header and in the `versionId` field in the response).
        You must then pass the record's version number in the update request (in the `If-Match` header).
        The update will only succeed if the patient record has not been updated in our database in the meantime.
        If the update succeeds, you will receive a copy of the update record in the response, including the new record version number.
        If you have a subsequent update you must use the new version number.

        ## Sandbox test scenarios
        You can test the following scenarios in our sandbox environment.
        Note that your changes will not be persisted.
        JSON Patch operations themselves are validated, but the resulting resource is not validated for correctness.
