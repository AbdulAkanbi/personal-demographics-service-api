          The level of security on the patients record, this will affect which fields will be populated on retrieval. The possible responses are:
          - U, meaning unrestricted. All available data will be returned.
          - R, meaning restricted. Any sensitive data around the patients location, such as address, gp practice, etc. will be removed from the response.
          - V, meaning very restricted. All patient identifiable data, such as name, date of birth, address, etc. will be removed from the response.
          - REDACTED, meaning redacted. The patient record has been marked as invalid, so the data should not be used. This code will never be returned and you will receive a 404 and appropriate error response if an invalidated patient retrieval is attempted.
          It is also possible that no security field will be added to the response, this is the equivalent to unrestricted.
