# Contribution Guidelines

## Raising an Issue
If you raise an issue against this repository, please include as much information as possible to reproduce any bugs,
or specific locations in the case of content errors.

## Contributing code
To contribute code, please fork the repository and raise a pull request.

Ideally pull requests should be fairly granular and aim to solve one problem each. It would also be helpful if they
linked to an issue. If the maintainers cannot understand why a pull request was raised, it will be rejected,
so please explain why the changes need to be made (unless it is self-evident).
